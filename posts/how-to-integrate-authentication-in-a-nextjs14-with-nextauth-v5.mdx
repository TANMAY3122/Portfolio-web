> Next Auth is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It provides a set of high-level APIs to manage user authentication, including sign-in, sign-out, passwordless authentication, and more. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to integrate NextAuth v5 with a Next.js 14 application to add authentication features to your project.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Next.js 14

## Step 1: Create a New Next.js 14 Project

First, let's create a new Next.js 14 project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-auth-app
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-next-auth-app
```

## Step 2: Install NextAuth v5

To install NextAuth, ensure you have the latest version by checking the NextAuth GitHub or npm page. For this tutorial, we will use a beta version:

```bash
npm install next-auth@beta
```

## Step 3: Configure NextAuth

To configure NextAuth, start by creating an auth.config.js file in the root of your project and add the following setup for Google authentication. Be sure to replace process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with your actual Google OAuth credentials:

```javascript
// auth.config.js
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google";

export default {
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      profile(profile) {
        return {
          id: profile.id,
          name: profile.name,
          email: profile.email,
          image: profile.picture,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

In this configuration, we are setting up Google as the authentication provider. You will need to replace process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with your own Google OAuth credentials.

## Step 4 : Create a MongoDB Client Promise

Create a new file in the app/helper/clientPromise.js and add the following code:

```javascript
// helper/clientPromise.js
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

if (!process.env.MONGODB_URI) {
  throw new Error('Invalid/Missing environment variable: "MONGODB_URI"');
}

const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
const options = {};

let client;
let clientPromise;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  if (!global._mongoClientPromise) {
    client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
    global._mongoClientPromise = client.connect();
  }
  clientPromise = global._mongoClientPromise;
} else {
  // In production mode, it's best to not use a global variable.
  client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
  clientPromise = client.connect();
}

// Export a module-scoped MongoClient promise. By doing this in a
// separate module, the client can be shared across functions.
export default clientPromise;
```

## Step 5 : Create a Custom Authentication Handler

Next, we need to create a custom authentication handler to handle the authentication flow. Create a new file in the app/auth.js and add the following code:

```javascript
// auth.js
import { MongoDBAdapter } from "@auth/mongodb-adapter";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import clientPromise from "./helper/clientPromise";
import authConfig from "./auth.config";

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  adapter: MongoDBAdapter(clientPromise),
  session: { strategy: "jwt" },
  callbacks: {
    session: async ({ session, token }) => {
      session.user = {
        id: token.sub,
        ...token,
      };
      return session;
    },
  },
  ...authConfig,
});
```

In this code, we are setting up a custom authentication handler using the MongoDBAdapter to store user data in a MongoDB database. You will need to replace the MongoDBAdapter with your own database adapter

## Step 6: Create the API Route

Next, we need to create an API route to handle the authentication flow. Create a new file in the app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js (route.ts if using TypeScript). Add the following code:

```javascript
// api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js
import { handlers } from "@/auth";

export const { GET, POST } = handlers;
```

## Step 7: Add Environment Variables

Next, we need to add the required environment variables to our project. Create a new file called .env.local in the root of your project and add the following:

```bash
// .env.local
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with your own Google OAuth credentials.

## Step 8: Add Auth Secret

Next, we need to add an auth secret to our project. Create a new file called .env.local in the root of your project and add the following:

```bash
// .env.local
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
```

Replace NEXTAUTH_SECRET with a random string of characters to use as the auth secret.

## Step 9: Add Authentication to Your NextJS App

Finally, we need to add authentication to our Next.js app. Update the app/layout.js, (layout.ts if you're using Typescript) file with the following code:

Wrap the entire app component with the SessionProvider component from next-auth/react:

```javascript
// layout.js
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```

## Step 10: Add Sign-In Button

Next, let's add a sign-in button to our app. Update the app/page.js (page.tsx if you're using Typescript) file with the following code:

```javascript
// app/page.js
import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from "next-auth/react";

export default function Page() {
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  return (
    <div>
      {!session ? (
        <button onClick={() => signIn("google")}>Sign in with Google</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Step 11: Test the Authentication Flow

Now that we have set up authentication in our Next.js app, let's test the authentication flow. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and try signing in with Google. You should be redirected to the Google sign-in page and then back to your app after successfully signing in.
